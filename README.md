# IMH Host

IMH is an Imgur parse through that accepts calls to upload and serves a frontend and screenshot extension. The IMH Host WILL NOT provide a frontend user experience, only the [client](https://github.com/raxracks/imh-client) can do that.

## Setup

Install NodeJS and NPM if you haven't already.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raxracks/imh-host
cd imh-host
npm install 
node .
```
You will need to deploy a website running the webserver somehow.
